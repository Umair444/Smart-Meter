-- A window will appear as you run, wait as the application is heavy
-- Press clear button to reset the UIAxes
-- Select the some date from MARCH, as this project is in sandby since lockdown
	(I'm not lying, May and June values are vitually generated from Write.m file)
-- Press Dynamic Ticks to get the interactive UIAxes, it'll give you the past data and then stop
-- Press draw with uncheck Dynamic Ticks; the UIAxes will not be interactive but it'll keep on running forever.
-- And take the warning serious if you don't want to crash the app, I might fix the crashes and some other bugs in some later version
