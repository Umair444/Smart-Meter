# C Shell - A Command Line Interpreter
## Execute Functions Directly on BASH
The project execute C code on shell (BASH terminal) and perform various linux commands, like changing, listing and making directories. The make file provided can be used to build the source code into a executable file. 
# Acknowledgement
The project is a part of my curriculum developed for System Programming coursework. A part of software engineering is to make the file easy to execute for end user, and the course taught by some of the greatest professor help a lot in this, for which I will be greatful forever.

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
To run build the source file using code, a C comiler must be installed in users computer. Executing the shell on linux or any Debian environment in preferable. But in case you have other OS, then GNU external libraries must be installed seperately. For Windows, you can use [CygWin](https://www.cygwin.com/install.html) or [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). 
The following GNU pacakges must are required for compilation
- libreadlinedevel
- gcc-core
- gcc-g++
- make
- gdb

`make` package can be used to directly build executable file from provided MakeFile

## Building the Software
- Use command `gcc -o uab_sh shell1.c -lreadline` to build exe file from C script
- Use `Makefile` command to build it from make file
